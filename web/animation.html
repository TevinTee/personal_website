        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I'm an aspiring software engineer who's eager and passionate about the tech industry.
            My educational journey started with studying towards a Diploma in Operations Management
            at the <span class="highlight">Durban University of Technology</span>. There, I explored topics ranging 
            from Business Management to Financial Accounting before transitioning to the tech industry.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout my journey at <span class="highlight">WeThinkCode_</span>, I've had the privilege of collaborating with 
            like-minded individuals who share a passion for coding. This experience has provided me with life-changing 
            opportunities to acquire new skills and knowledge that are vital for my career progression.

        <p>
            My knowledge spans Python programming, Java OOP, and advanced topics such as Docker, Web Development, 
            Relational Databases, REST APIs, Web Services, CI/CD, Systems Integration, and Git. These concepts, 
            while challenging, are incredibly exciting and instrumental in shaping my development as a software engineer.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I continue my journey at <span class="highlight">WeThinkCode_</span>, I'm enthusiastic about exploring upcoming 
            concepts and chapters. I look forward to transitioning into the workplace as a 
            <span class="highlight">Junior Software Developer</span> and contributing to the tech industry.
